        <p>There are so many reasons why reading is the best hobby. I have to admit that I am writing this from a biased perspective. I absolutely love reading. I have a passionate love affair with books and nothing makes me happier than to have a stack of books on my nightstand to attack on a night when there is no alarm clock waiting the next morning. Let me share with you the reasons why reading is the best hobby you can have.
            <br>
            <br>One of the reasons why reading is the best hobby is because it expands your horizons. It gives you something new and different to enjoy. And there are so many diverse subjects that you can read about that you are learning something every time that you read. You can learn practically anything from reading a good book on the subject. Even if you choose to read fiction, you may learn something that is helpful in your life.</br>
            </br> Reading causes your mind to work differently than when you are watching television. It is a way to stretch your mind to grasp new concepts. It also makes your mind work to interpret images. It is healthy for your brain and keeps your brain functioning actively. This can help keep your mentality sharp as you age.</p>
